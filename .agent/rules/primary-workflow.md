# Primary Workflow

## Step 1: Understand

- Read `./README.md` for project context
- Analyze the user's request
- If unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding

## Step 2: Analyze

- Research the codebase, existing patterns, and relevant files
- Save analysis as `docs/XX-Analysis-Name-Date.md`

## Step 3: Plan

- Create implementation plan based on analysis
- Save plan as `docs/XX-Plan-Name-Date.md`
- **Send plan for user approval — do NOT implement until approved**

## Step 4: Implement

- After approval, execute all phases continuously
- Follow established code patterns and architecture
- Run compile/build after each major change
- Only pause if encountering errors or needing user decisions

## Step 5: Verify

- Run tests and verify functionality
- Check for build errors
- Save report as `docs/XX-Report-Name-Date.md`

## Notes

- Activate relevant skills from the catalog as needed during the process
- Keep token usage efficient while maintaining quality
- For quick fixes (< 5 minutes work), skip Steps 2-3 and fix directly
