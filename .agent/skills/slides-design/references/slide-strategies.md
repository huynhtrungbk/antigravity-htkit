## Duarte Sparkline Pattern

Alternate between "What Is" (current pain) and "What Could Be" (better future):

```
What Is → What Could Be → What Is → What Could Be → New Bliss
(pain)     (hope)         (pain)     (hope)         (resolution)
```

Pattern breaks at 1/3 and 2/3 positions create engagement peaks.
